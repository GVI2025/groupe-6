## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/simplewms.git
cd simplewms
```

### 2. Install Poetry (if not already installed)

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

Ensure `poetry` is available in your terminal:

```bash
poetry --version
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
poetry install
```

### 4. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
poetry shell

### 5. Set up the database

The application uses SQLite by default (configured in `app/database/database.py`).

To create the schema, run:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

If needed, you can generate migrations using:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
```

### 6. Seed the database with test data

```bash
python -m app.seed.seed_data
```

### 7. Run the application

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
